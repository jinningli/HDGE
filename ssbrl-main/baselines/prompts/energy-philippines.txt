Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards Philippines on the topic of energy, manufacturing, or military. The tweet either has a pro-Philippines, anti-Philippines, or neutral stance on its energy or manufacturing practice. In most of the cases, the tweet concerns Philippines versus China; you should classify sentiment from the Philippines's perspective. For example, if the tweet has positive sentiment on Philippines or negative sentiment on China, then you should classify this tweet as "supportive", and vice versa. Keep in mind the Philippines' alliance with the U.S. in your analysis. In the very rare case, there will be "neutral" views (for example, the tweet is simply stating a fact or news). The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

{
    "tweets": [
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": 1609574792490885123,
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
