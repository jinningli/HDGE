Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards Russia on the topic of energy, manufacturing, or military. The tweet either has a pro-Russia, anti-Russia, or neutral stance on its energy, manufacturing, or military practice. In most of the cases, the tweet concerns Russia versus U.S; you should classify sentiment from the Russia's perspective. For example, if the tweet has positive sentiment on Russia or negative sentiment on U.S, then you should classify this tweet as "supportive", and vice versa. Keep in mind the Russia' alliance with the China in your analysis. In the very rare case, there will be "neutral" views. The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:
