Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards Western countries (United States, NATO, Philippines, etc) on the topic of energy and energy practices. The tweet either has a pro-Western, anti-Western, or neutral stance on Western domestic political practice. 

For example, some tweets may comment on the Philippines versus China, or United States versus China, or the United States versus Ukraine; you should classify sentiment from the Western country's perspective. Western countries include the United States, NATO countries, the Philippines, and Ukraine. The Eastern countries include Russia, China, Iran, etc. For example, if the tweet has positive sentiment in the Philippines or negative sentiment in China, then you should classify this tweet as "supportive" (because it is Pro-Western), and vice versa. In very rare cases, there will be "neutral" views (it is neutral when the tweet is not concerned with energy issues). The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

{
    "tweets": [
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": 1609574792490885123,
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
