Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards China on the topic of energy, manufacturing, or military. The tweet either has a pro-China, anti-China, or neutral stance on its labor and migration, or manufacturing practice. In most of the cases, the tweet concerns China versus U.S; you should classify sentiment from the China's perspective. For example, if the tweet has positive sentiment on China or negative sentiment on U.S., then you should classify this tweet as "supportive", and vice versa. Keep in mind the United States' alliance with the Philippine, Japan, and Ukraine in your analysis. In the very rare case, there will be "neutral" views. The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

{
    "tweets": [
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": 1609574792490885123,
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
