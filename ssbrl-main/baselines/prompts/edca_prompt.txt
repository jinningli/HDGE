Given a set of tweet, independently determine if of each of them expresses a supportive or opposing view towards the topic on Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) is an agreement between the United States and the Philippines intended to bolster the American‚ÄìPhilippine alliance. Classify the sentiment as either "supportive" (for all tweets that are pro-Philippines or Pro its allies including the United States, or those that are anti-China) or "opposing" (tweets that are anti-philippines or Pro-China). In the very rare case there will be "netural" views. The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

{
    "tweets": [
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": 1609574792490885123,
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
