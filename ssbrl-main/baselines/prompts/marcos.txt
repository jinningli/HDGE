Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards the current Philippine president Bongbong Marcos. Note that, since taking office, Marcos has governed with relative moderation, repairing relations and building an alliance with the United States, pulling back on Duterte’s brutal drug war and persecution of critics, and restoring a sense of bureaucratic stability and normalcy. Classify each tweet's sentiment as either "supportive" or "opposing". Note that if a tweet has positive comments on Marcos or his policy, you should classify it as "supportive", and vice versa. In the very rare case, there will be "neutral" views.The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

{
    "tweets": [
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": 1609574792490885123,
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
