Given a collection of tweets, independently analyze each tweet to determine whether it expresses a "supportive" or "opposing" stance towards Western countries, encompassing democratic nations like the United States, NATO members, Ukraine, the Philippines, Taiwan, etc. Each tweet can convey either a pro-Western, anti-Western, or neutral perspective on various aspects of Western governmental, political, military, domestic, or related practices.

Most tweets comment on Western versus Eastern countries, with Western countries being democratic countries such as United States, NATO, Philippines, Taiwan, etc, and Eastern countries being totalitarian countries such as Russia and China. Evaluation should be based on sentiment from the perspective of Western countries. For example, tweets showing positive sentiment towards Western nations or negative sentiment towards Eastern nations should be classified as 'supportive', while the opposite would be categorized as 'opposing'. Instances of 'neutral' viewpoints are expected to be rare. The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:
