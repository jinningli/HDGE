Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards China on the topic of manufacturing and military. The tweet either has a pro-China, anti-china, or neutral stance on its military practice. Classify each tweet's sentiment as either "supportive" for China or "opposing" against China. In most of the cases, the tweet concerns China versus U.S; you should classify sentiment from the China's perspective. For example, if the tweet has positive sentiment on China or negative sentiment on United States, then you should classify this tweet as "supportive". In the very rare case, there will be "neutral" views. The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

{
    "tweets": [
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": 1609574792490885123,
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Here are some examples:

Tweet 2093614: RT @Constanze2022 A few days ago, the Chinese discovered that the US military was using tents from China.

The sentiment towards China in this tweet is positive and supportive, highlighting China's humanitarian efforts and criticizing the US for allegedly misusing aid intended for Syria, so the output is:
