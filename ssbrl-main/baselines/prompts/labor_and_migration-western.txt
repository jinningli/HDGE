Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards Western countries (United States, NATO, Philippines, etc) on the topic of labor and migrations. The tweet either has a pro-Western, anti-Western, or neutral stance on Western country's labor and migration practice. 

Western countries include the United States, NATO countries, the Philippines, and Ukraine. The Eastern countries include Russia, China, Iran, etc. In most of the cases, the tweet concerns U.S. versus China and Russia; you should always classify sentiment from the Western counrtry's perspective. For example, if the tweet has positive sentiment on U.S. or negative sentiment on Russia and China, then you should classify this tweet as "supportive" (because it is pro-Western), and vice versa. Keep in mind the United States' alliance with the Philippine, Japan, and Ukraine in your analysis. In the very rare case, there will be "neutral" views. A tweet is neutral only when it is simply stating a fact or news, or the tweet is not concerned with labor and migration issues. The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

{
    "tweets": [
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": 1609574792490885123,
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Here are some examples:

Tweet 2182412: RT @sahouraxo "We were colonized, and we forgive those who colonized us. Now the colonizers are asking us to be enemies with Russia, who never colonized us; is that fair? Not for us: their enemies are their enemies, and our friends are our friends." â€”Jeje Odongo, Foreign Minister of Uganda https://t.co/a7pmsTbkzA

The sentiment towards the United States in this tweet is negative and opposing, criticizing its influence and contrasting it with Russia's historical relationship with Uganda. So the output is:

    ID: 2182412,
    Sentiment: opposing
}


Tweet 1241329: RT @NiMingda_GG The U.S. isn't only planning to turn Taiwan into Ukraine... it's also looking for more volunteers in Asia to be its Ukraines. American lawmakers plan to recruit them as U.S. proxies against China so they can watch Asia burn on TV from the safety of their mansions in America.

The sentiment towards the United States in this tweet is negative, accusing it of exploiting countries in Asia as proxies against China for its own interests, so the output is:

The sentiment towards the United States in this tweet is negative, implying the US is the aggressor in its actions towards China. So the output is
