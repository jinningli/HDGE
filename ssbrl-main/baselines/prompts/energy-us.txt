Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards the United States on the topic of energy, manufacturing, or military. The tweet either has a pro-US, anti-US, or neutral stance on its energy, manufacturing, or military practice. In most of the cases, the tweet concerns U.S. versus China and Russia; you should classify sentiment from the U.S's perspective. For example, if the tweet has positive sentiment on U.S. or negative sentiment on Russia and China, then you should classify this tweet as "supportive", and vice versa. Keep in mind the United States' alliance with the Philippine, Japan, and Ukraine in your analysis. In the very rare case, there will be "neutral" views. The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

        },
        ...
    ]
}
