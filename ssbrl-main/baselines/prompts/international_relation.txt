Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards the Western government on the topic of international relations. The tweet either has a pro-Western, anti-Western, or neutral stance on its government policy and / or military practice on international relations. "Western" government means countries like United States and its allies like NATO. If the tweet expresses a negative sentiment or comment on Western government (like criticizing the government policy, government control, or military), you should classify it as "opposing," and vice versa. For example, if the tweet criticizes Putin for starting the Ukraine war, then you should label it as "supportive" because it is pro-Western. Similarly, if the tweet expresses positive sentiment on China's military practices, then it is "opposing" because it is anti-Western. Keep in mind that the China-Russia alliance and United States-Philippine alliance in your analysis. In the very rare case, there will be "neutral" views. The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

{
    "tweets": [
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE] (Either "opposing", "supportive", or "neutral")
        },
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE] (Either "opposing", "supportive", or "neutral")
        },
        {
            "ID": 1609574792490885123,
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE] (Either "opposing", "supportive", or "neutral")
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Here are some examples:
