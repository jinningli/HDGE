Given a set of tweets, independently determine if each of them expresses a supportive or opposing stance towards the government on the topic of politics and crimes. If the tweet expresses a negtaive sentiment or comment on government (like criticizing the police, government policy, government control, or judiciary system), you should classify it as "opposing", (since it is anti-government). Similarly, if the tweet is pro-government, you should classify it as "supportive".

In the very rare case, there will be "neutral" views. The expected response format is an array of JSON objects as follows:

{
    "tweets": [
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": [INSERT TWEET_ID HERE],
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        {
            "ID": 1609574792490885123,
            "Sentiment": [INSERT SENTIMENT HERE]
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Here are some examples:

Tweet 2182412: RT @DonaldJTrumpJr Our corrupt elites aren't threatened by violent criminals on the streets because all of them have private security.

The sentiment expressed towards the government and its elites in this tweet is negative, criticizing the government and elites' indifference to public safety, so the output is:
